# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 24th August

**Today's Progress**: 
I've gone through the next exercise on Skillshare's "Interactive Data Visualization: Getting Started with D3.js" course. I created webpage to access and load CSV file into browser.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling I'm making steady progress and looking forward to tomorrow's session.

### Day 2: Tuesday, 25th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I was introduced to the concept of "promises" in JavaScript.  Promise functions allows the code to "wait" until a specific function has completed, then proceed to the next function.

I also started plotting shapes on X and Y axis today. I also learned how to plot circles as well as link the size and position of the circles to data values in a CSV file.

**Thoughts** 
I making steady progress which is great. A great byproduct is that I'm beginning to master how to use eclipse IDE. Consistently using it every day has enabled me to become more more familiar with quirks and nuances. This definitely makes coding within eclipse much easier!

### Day 3: Tuesday, 26th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
today I learned how to use d3 scale functions to position values in an svg object relative to the size of the canvas. Also how to sort data and find the minimum and maximum values within the column of data. All of this is working towards creating a scatter plot chart.

**Thoughts** 
it's important to document each function as I create it. Even though I understand it at the time, coming back to it a day or so later at this stage of my learning is difficult to comprehend what's going on.

### Day 4: Thursday, 27th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
debugging, debugging, and more debugging. I have no idea what has gone wrong with my code. I've got no syntax errors, but the databases doing strange things it shouldn't be.

**Thoughts** 
it's been a long day and I'm doing my coding late in the evening. Maybe an idea to tackle this first thing in the morning when my mind is fresh.

### Day 5: Friday 28th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
I won my debugging war today ! pesky semantic errors are the worst. they look like butter wouldn't melt but cause so much problems.   

**Thoughts** 
it was definitely a great idea to tackle my debugging issues first thing in the morning.  Attacking the problem with a clear head definitely helped.

### Day 6: Saturday 29th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Learnt how to use d3 axis functions to create and label axes. Important to control which tick marks on the axes are visible because the default options are useful but not always good DataViz practice. 

**Thoughts** 
Grouping and shifting over the axes as a whole using svg "group" elements is crucial else you have to manually adjust all relevant axis elements individually.

### Day 7: Sunday 30th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
created axis for my D3 DataViz and formatted them with CSS. Learnt how to use the D3 axis functions as well as how to transform/position them to where I want.	
 
**Thoughts** 
I had another pesky semantic error today. I've heard about JavaScript's legendary debugging difficulties. I think and begin to understand much better what people mean. In fairness, the problem was totally my fault, nothing to do with JavaScript :).

### Day 8: Monday 31th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Had a great day learning how to add animation to my D3 scatter plot using the transition function. The functions were surprisingly easy to use. More straightforward than I thought!

**Thoughts** 
Also took the time to heavily comment on my code.

### Day 9: Tuesday 1st of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Not much coding today however, equally as important as setting up and tweaking my working environment and eclipse. Specifically, I set up content assist options. This definitely help to make writing code easier as well as highlighting multiple occurrences of the same variables.

**Thoughts** 
Time well spent even though not much coding than today.

### Day 10: Thursday 3rd of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned how to add interactivity to my DataViz by creating a tooltip function.  

**Thoughts** 
working regularly with D3 everyday is starting to make a big difference.

### Day 11: Friday 4th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Learnt how to add finishing touches to my dataviz such as axis labels and how to format the overall DataViz from left to right so that it's easier for your audience to understand. 

**Thoughts** 
These finishing touches can be tedious but they make the difference between an okay DataViz and a great DataViz.
