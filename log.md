# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 24th August

**Today's Progress**: 
I've gone through the next exercise on Skillshare's "Interactive Data Visualization: Getting Started with D3.js" course. I created webpage to access and load CSV file into browser.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling I'm making steady progress and looking forward to tomorrow's session.
