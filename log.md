# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 24th August

**Today's Progress**: 
I've gone through the next exercise on Skillshare's "Interactive Data Visualization: Getting Started with D3.js" course. I created webpage to access and load CSV file into browser.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling I'm making steady progress and looking forward to tomorrow's session.

### Day 2: Tuesday, 25th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I was introduced to the concept of "promises" in JavaScript.  Promise functions allows the code to "wait" until a specific function has completed, then proceed to the next function.

I also started plotting shapes on X and Y axis today. I also learned how to plot circles as well as link the size and position of the circles to data values in a CSV file.

**Thoughts** 
I making steady progress which is great. A great byproduct is that I'm beginning to master how to use eclipse IDE. Consistently using it every day has enabled me to become more more familiar with quirks and nuances. This definitely makes coding within eclipse much easier!

### Day 3: Tuesday, 26th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
today I learned how to use d3 scale functions to position values in an svg object relative to the size of the canvas. Also how to sort data and find the minimum and maximum values within the column of data. All of this is working towards creating a scatter plot chart.

**Thoughts** 
it's important to document each function as I create it. Even though I understand it at the time, coming back to it a day or so later at this stage of my learning is difficult to comprehend what's going on.
