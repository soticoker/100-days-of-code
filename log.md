**Today's Progress**: 
I've gone through the next exercise on Skillshare's "Interactive Data Visualization: Getting Started with D3.js" course. I created webpage to access and load CSV file into browser.

**Thoughts** 
I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling I'm making steady progress and looking forward to tomorrow's session.

### Day 2: Tuesday, 25th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I was introduced to the concept of "promises" in JavaScript.  Promise functions allows the code to "wait" until a specific function has completed, then proceed to the next function.

I also started plotting shapes on X and Y axis today. I also learned how to plot circles as well as link the size and position of the circles to data values in a CSV file.

**Thoughts** 
I making steady progress which is great. A great byproduct is that I'm beginning to master how to use eclipse IDE. Consistently using it every day has enabled me to become more more familiar with quirks and nuances. This definitely makes coding within eclipse much easier!

**Today's Progress**: 
today I learned how to use d3 scale functions to position values in an svg object relative to the size of the canvas. Also how to sort data and find the minimum and maximum values within the column of data. All of this is working towards creating a scatter plot chart.

**Thoughts** 
it's important to document each function as I create it. Even though I understand it at the time, coming back to it a day or so later at this stage of my learning is difficult to comprehend what's going on.

### Day 4: Thursday, 27th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
debugging, debugging, and more debugging. I have no idea what has gone wrong with my code. I've got no syntax errors, but the databases doing strange things it shouldn't be.

**Thoughts** 
it's been a long day and I'm doing my coding late in the evening. Maybe an idea to tackle this first thing in the morning when my mind is fresh.

**Today's Progress**: 
I won my debugging war today ! pesky semantic errors are the worst. they look like butter wouldn't melt but cause so much problems.   

**Thoughts** 
it was definitely a great idea to tackle my debugging issues first thing in the morning.  Attacking the problem with a clear head definitely helped.

### Day 6: Saturday 29th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Learnt how to use d3 axis functions to create and label axes. Important to control which tick marks on the axes are visible because the default options are useful but not always good DataViz practice. 

**Thoughts** 
Grouping and shifting over the axes as a whole using svg "group" elements is crucial else you have to manually adjust all relevant axis elements individually.

### Day 7: Sunday 30th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
created axis for my D3 DataViz and formatted them with CSS. Learnt how to use the D3 axis functions as well as how to transform/position them to where I want.	
 
**Thoughts** 
I had another pesky semantic error today. I've heard about JavaScript's legendary debugging difficulties. I think and begin to understand much better what people mean. In fairness, the problem was totally my fault, nothing to do with JavaScript :).

### Day 8: Monday 31th of August

**Today's Progress**: 
Had a great day learning how to add animation to my D3 scatter plot using the transition function. The functions were surprisingly easy to use. More straightforward than I thought!

**Thoughts** 
Also took the time to heavily comment on my code.

### Day 9: Tuesday 1st of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Not much coding today however, equally as important as setting up and tweaking my working environment and eclipse. Specifically, I set up content assist options. This definitely help to make writing code easier as well as highlighting multiple occurrences of the same variables.

**Thoughts** 
Time well spent even though not much coding than today.

### Day 10: Thursday 3rd of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Learned how to add interactivity to my DataViz by creating a tooltip function.  

**Thoughts** 
working regularly with D3 everyday is starting to make a big difference.

**Today's Progress**: 
Learnt how to add finishing touches to my dataviz such as axis labels and how to format the overall DataViz from left to right so that it's easier for your audience to understand. 

**Thoughts** 
These finishing touches can be tedious but they make the difference between an okay DataViz and a great DataViz.

### Day 12: Sunday 5th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Checked out D3 resources & examples on D3 website.
My goal is to create a Scrollytelling project. I've heard many times that the best way to learn code is by creating a project you have passion for.  Therefore, I found a project that similar to the one I want to accomplish so I'm going to dissect it and break it down piece by piece. Here's the 

Scrollytelling project by Bill Shander:
https://beehivemedia.com/dataviz/occupations/

https://medium.com/nightingale/creating-a-multisegment-scrollytelling-data-story-from-scratch-key-moments-and-lessons-e544ccdea516

I realise now I'll also have to learn these key concepts:
How to write fewer functions by using lodash https://lodash.com/
and how to use Waypoints http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/

**Thoughts** 
definitely feels like a big challenge. I'm not sure if I'd bitten off more than I can chew at this point. I guess we'll find out!

### Day 13: Monday 5th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Learn how to use Waypoints in HTML. Realised that they can be a handful to update and maintain so will have to write code to make this process more efficient.

**Thoughts** 
There are many pieces to this jigsaw. There's a lot of work besides coding that needs to be done making it difficult to code every day.

### Day 14: Wednesday 6th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Investigated 6 different processes for creating scrollytelling pages. Started creating a small version to get everything working and test out.

**Thoughts** 
keep on moving.

### Day 15: Thursday 7th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Realised today that I need to pause and improve my web development skills first. I need to be able to manipulate a webpage so it's a step back to HTML webpage creation 101.

**Thoughts**: 
found an online course that I can use with the scrolllama.js JavaScript library. I'm hoping to adapt this tutorial to my own DataViz story as I progress instead of completing the tutorial first, then adapting it etc.

### Day 17: Sunday 13th of September
![1st-Scrollytelling-project_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63045067/93025472-31885680-f5f6-11ea-9681-0d4c4af7f3d5.gif)

**Today's Progress**: 
Decided to use the scrollama.js JavaScript library to do the heavy lifting. Have been experimenting with this and working on a small skeleton Scrollytelling framework. Finally completed it today! It's pretty basic, but it's a good foundation to build off.

**Thoughts**: 
definitely a good idea to stop focusing on completing tutorials to start creating your own real-world projects.

### Day 18: Tuesday 15th of September

**Today's Progress**: 

![scrollama](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63045067/93252625-a80b8c80-f78d-11ea-9320-4d610d3cabfd.png)

Reading up on scrollama.js Documentation
https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama#how-to-use

**Thoughts**: 
My CSS isn't as strong as I thought it was, need to brush up on that.

### Day 19: Thursday 17th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
still learning CSS and experimented with some alternative CSS setups.

**Thoughts**: 
CSS is a vast topic so it's important to learn just enough to keep you moving forward.

### Day 20: Saturday 19th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
For the last week, I've been transitioning from Eclipse IDE to  Visual studio code. This has left little time for d3. I also use Vocola for voice coding to help with typing fatigue and to program JavaScript so have been setting up my new coding environment.

**Thoughts**: 
Even though it's been frustrating not doing as much coding as I'd like to have done this week, it's been time well spent! VS code is a much better code editor than Eclipse.

### Day 21: Monday 20th of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Have been experimenting & tweaking my scrollama.js setup. So much is possible, have been exploring.    

**Thoughts**: 
Time to turn my focus back to core D3 programming & take a break from web dev/CSS stuff.

### Day 22: Tuesday 21st of September

**Today's Progress**: 
Bookmarked my favourite d3 chart examples from D3.org that I'm likely to use for my project and working through their sample code. Discover D3.org's sister platform observable, signed up and started using that.

**Thoughts**: 
Great to take a break from Scrollytelling/CSS/Web development and refocus on D3 again!

### Day 23: Thursday 24th of September
![ukgeomap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63045067/94185841-bd736b80-fe9d-11ea-9c2f-5052bcb3d899.png)

**Today's Progress**: 
I'm trying to Creating a UK choropleth map in D3. I need to create a GeoJSON file and the steps involved are:

find shape files
choose a resolution
simplify the shapes
convert to GeoJSON
choose a projection

Have completed all the steps except for "choose a projection"

**Thoughts**: 
need to read up on how to choose the right projection for my maps:

**Today's Progress**: 
Struggling with Choosing a projection and getting it to work work in d3. Today I analysed and narrowed down my problem to the fact that I need to choose my projection method more carefully and study which parameters need to be set in order for that projection to work.

**Thoughts**: 
Working with projections in D3 is harder than I anticipated and I must admit, it's driving me crazy.

### Day 25: Saturday 3rd of October 

![myd3worldmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63045067/94987515-d4315680-055e-11eb-8ac3-32aa69b0ff19.jpg)

**Today's Progress**: 
Success! After a week of fighting with d3, actually fighting with geometric data and rendering it in D3, I have a successful world map!

**Thoughts**: 
There are many steps involved in this process, many places to trip up. However, I reckon it's a good idea to not start from scratch when it comes to GIS data until you are at least intermediate skill level. 

My Achilles heel in this process was dealing with Geojson and TopoJSON data. I needed to better understand the underlying structure or at least be better able to "see" the data or have a better way of understanding how it was structured.

There is so much great work out there already done to help you get started. I simply didn't realise that. The upshot is, I've learned a lot more about GIS data, shape files, GeoJSON, TopoJSON, map projections etc.

**Next steps**
I need to filter this world map data and only show the UK countries.

**Today's Progress**: 
Edited my world map d3 projection and created a UK map projection.  Had trouble for a while accessing the correct objects within the UK TopoJSON structure.  
This can be tricky to get.   

**Thoughts**: 
my map is kind of small.  I need to work on the scaling function is to get the right size.

**Next steps**: 
Implement mouseover functions
